### Useful docker-compose commands 




docker-compose ps # lists all services (id, name)
docker-compose stop <id/name> #this will stop only the selected container
docker-compose rm <id/name> # this will remove the docker container permanently 
docker-compose up # builds/rebuilds all not already built container 


docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build

  --force-recreate    Recreate containers even if their configuration
                      and image haven't changed.
